This is an x86-64 bomb for self-study students. 



## Hints

Print out the bomb's symbol table, and then we can find some clues.

```
objdump -t bomb
```

Use gdb :

```
gdb bomb
```

To deal with functions like `phase_x()`, we can do these first :

```
b phase_x
b explode_bomb
```

(Breakpoints can avoid the bomb explodes and help us defuse it more easily.)

Then we can run it with arbitrary arguments under the debugger, watch what it does step by step, and use this information to find the right arguments and defuse it.
